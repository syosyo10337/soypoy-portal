            ## Additional Review Guidelines

            In addition to general code review, please verify the following:

            1. **Static Analysis**: Run `pnpm check` (runs tsc + biome lint + format) and report any errors or warnings found.

            2. **CLAUDE.md Compliance**: Read the CLAUDE.md file at the repository root and verify that the changes follow all conventions and rules defined there, including:
               - Clean Architecture dependency rules
               - TypeScript conventions (type imports, path aliases)
               - Biome formatting rules (double quotes, semicolons, 2-space indent)
               - Styling conventions (Tailwind CSS, cn() utility, color theme)
               - Date handling (Luxon, Asia/Tokyo timezone)
               - File organization patterns

            3. **Documentation Compliance**: Read all files under the `docs/` directory and verify the changes do not violate any architectural decisions, setup guides, or project conventions documented there. Key docs include:
               - docs/architecture-responsibilities.md
               - docs/project-structure.md
               - docs/database-setup.md
               - docs/admin-authentication.md
               - docs/admin-management.md

            If any violations are found, clearly explain which rule or convention is being violated and suggest a fix.
